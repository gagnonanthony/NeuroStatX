    tagline: NeuroStatX is a command-line toolbox to perform statistical analysis on
              neuroscience data. It had been developped mostly as part of my PhD project,
              which aims to understand the relationship between the brain, cognition and
              behavior, hence the focus on neuroscience data. As my project goes forward,
              new functionalities and scripts will be added. Contributions are welcome!
