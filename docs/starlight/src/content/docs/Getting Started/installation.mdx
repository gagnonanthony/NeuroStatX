### Through PyPI.

It is highly recommended to install `neurostatx` into a **python virtual
environment**. To do so, please follow these steps:
```bash
pipx install virtualenv

# Set up the virtualenv.
virtualenv --python 3.11 /path/to/your/destination/folder/

# Activate your newly created environment
source /path/to/your/destination/folder/bin/activate
```

Then, to install through PyPI, simply use pip:
```bash
pip install neurostatx
```

### From source (for developpers).

**This library uses *poetry* to manage dependencies. To install it, use pipx with
the following command:**

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

:::caution
Poetry is creating is own virtual environment by default. Therefore, be sure
to deactivate all of your virtual environment before continuing on with the
installation.
:::

**To install NeuroStatX and all of its dependencies, run this set of commands:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gagnonanthony/NeuroStatX.git
cd NeuroStatX/
poetry install
```

:::note
The `poetry install` command will install all required dependencies as well
as setting up a virtual environment. To access the library environment, use:
`poetry shell` from the project root directory. This will activate the
project's python environment in your current shell.
To access your environment from other directories, use this command (from
within the project directory), you might need to modify ~/.bashrc to your 
specific login shell (ex: MacOS sometimes uses zsh, so ~/.zshrc or
~/.zprofile):
```bash
ENVPATH=$(poetry env info --path)
echo "export NeuroStatXPATH=${ENVPATH}" >> ~/.bashrc
```
:::

**Restart your terminal. You should now be able to activate the poetry
environment by using: `source $NeuroStatXPATH/bin/activate` from anywhere.**

### Installing Graphviz
Graphviz is an external dependencies required to visualize semplot from the
``semopy`` package used within NeuroStatX. If you do not have Graphviz
installed on your machine, please run the following if you are on Linux
`sudo apt get graphviz` or `brew install graphviz` if you are on MacOS.
