title: Fuzzy Clustering with NeuroStatX
description: Learn how to project new participants into existing fuzzy clusters or compute fuzzy clusters from scratch using the NeuroStatX package.
---

:::caution
The fuzzy clustering API will undergo significant improvements to reflect a structure more
similar to `sklearn`. While this tutorial should work with the current version of
`NeuroStatX`, it might change in the near future.
:::

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [**`NeuroStatX`**](https://github.com/gagnonanthony/NeuroStatX)
Python package for fuzzy clustering in cognitive-behavioral neuroscience. We'll focus on two use cases:

1. **Projecting new data onto precomputed fuzzy centroids** (e.g., for generalization or replication across cohorts).
2. **Running fuzzy c-means clustering from scratch** to derive data-driven participant profiles.

The clustering approach and validation strategies are detailed in our paper:

### Projecting New Participants to Precomputed Centroids

This is useful when you have:
- Fuzzy centroids already derived on a training set (provided in `NeuroStatX`)
- New participant data in the same feature space

### Why predicting?
Predicting avoids re-fitting clustering and ensures comparability across cohorts.
It is also a major advantage when your population does not have enough subjects
to derive clusters. Then, precomputed centroids from large databases come in handy!

### Requirements for predicting new data into existing centroids.

While the actual prediction is trivial, there is some mandatory assumptions or
requirements that need to be met in order to obtain acceptable and sound results.

1. If using the centroids from Gagnon A. _et al._ (2025), your data needs to include the
features [`Internalizing`, `Externalizing`, `Stress`, `VA`, `EFPS`, `MEM`] in this specific order.
2. Your data needs to be scaled in order to obtain a mean of 0 with standard deviation of 1. This
step can be performed using `sklearn`.

### Viewing test data

`NeuroStatX` provides a command-line (CLI) tool to predict fuzzy membership values. It also ships
the centroids from the profiles extracted in Gagnon A _et al._ (2025). Let's go through
an example with the `data/example.csv` file. Let's quickly load it in a python console
and look at its structure before using the CLI script.

```python
from neurostatx.io.loader import DatasetLoader

# Load example.csv from the /data folder.
df = DatasetLoader().load_data("data/example.csv")
df.get_data().head(5)
print(df.get_metadata())
```
```csv
      ids     Sex   Age       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM
0  PC2VLN  Female  10.9  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885

2  F6OQK5    Male  10.7 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549
3  TJWBKZ    Male  10.3 -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835
4  KWQW9D    Male  10.8 -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617
{'nb_subjects': 50, 'nb_variables': 9}
```

As you can see, we have 50 subjects with 9 features. The first three feature are
descriptive variables representing the ID, sex, and age. The next six features are
our features of interest. As you can see, the `Int` and `Ext` column do not match
our predefined column name, as long they respect the same order, this should not
be a problem for now. Let's try this out and see what will come out.

### Using the CLI script

To test this out, we will use the `PredictFuzzyMembership` CLI script. First, let's call
the help to see which inputs are required.

```bash
PredictFuzzyMembership --help
```

We can see from the script's help that only those files are required:

1. Input dataset.
1. Centroids.
1. Name of the column containing subject IDs.
1. Number of descriptive columns to ignore at the beginning of the dataset.

However, feature reduction was performed prior to clustering in Gagnon A _et al._ (2025).
The `NeuroStatX` also provides the loadings for this PCA model, we need to supply it
at runtime to ensure the same feature reduction is also performed on our new subjects.

Now, let's truly test this out with the `data/example.csv` dataset (keep in mind,
the name of the columns do not match the required naming.)

```bash
PredictFuzzyMembership \
    --in-dataset data/example.csv \
    --in-cntr data/GagnonA_2025_centroids.xlsx \
    --id-column ids \
    --desc-columns 3 \
    --pca \
    --pca-model data/GagnonA_2025_pca.pkl \
    --out-folder testPredictFuzzy/ \
    -v -s -f
```
You should obtain logging information similar to this:
```bash
2025-06-26 15:29:27 Anthonys-MacBook-Pro-2.local root[47854] INFO Loading dataset(s)...
2025-06-26 15:29:27 Anthonys-MacBook-Pro-2.local root[47854] INFO Loading PCA model...

2025-06-26 15:29:27 Anthonys-MacBook-Pro-2.local root[47854] INFO Saving results...
```

**Your new subjects have been successfully projected in the profile space of Gagnon A. _et al._ (2025)!**
Let's inspect the results. You can find them in the `testPredictFuzzy/` folder.

### Radar plot

One interesting way to visualize clustering results is using a radar plot. Those are automatically
generated when you predict new data. Here is the one from our earlier prediction.

![radarplot](/src/assets/tutorials/radarplotprediction.png)

We can see they reproduce the findings from the original paper! That is exactly what we want.
Let's now view the results using a graph network.

### Constructing a graph network

To do this, let's head back into the python console and inspect our new membership values.

```python
from neurostatx.io.loader import DatasetLoader

# Load the output from the previous script.
df = DatasetLoader().load_data("testPredictFuzzy/predicted_membership_matrix.xlsx")
df.get_data().head(5)
```
```csv
      ids     Sex   Age       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM  Cluster #1  Cluster #2  Cluster #3  Cluster #4
0  PC2VLN  Female  10.9  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885    0.650611    0.126757    0.103559    0.119073
1  XL1LON    Male  11.6  0.712829  0.893640  0.629955  0.446043  0.422631  0.336953    0.379016    0.439541    0.104214    0.077230
2  F6OQK5    Male  10.7 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549    0.136026    0.665600    0.076213    0.122161
3  TJWBKZ    Male  10.3 -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835    0.090768    0.064187    0.426084    0.418961
4  KWQW9D    Male  10.8 -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617    0.050047    0.039926    0.265102    0.644925
```

We can see that the membership values for our four clusters have been appended to the original dataframe!
We can use those membership values to build our graph network. Let's leverage additional
`NeuroStatX` function to do so. Most of those functions have been explained in the [Introduction to NeuroStatX](/NeuroStatX/tutorials/intro)
section.

```python
from neurostatx.io.loader import GraphLoader
from neurostatx.network.utils import get_nodes_and_edges

# Let's drop the descriptive column and original scores.
df.drop_columns([i for i in range(1,9)])

# Let's now construct pairs of subject-centroid nodes.
pairs, _, _ = df.custom_function(
    get_nodes_and_edges
)

# Now build our graph.
G = GraphLoader().build_graph(
    pairs,
    "node1",
    "node2",
    edge_attr="membership"
)

# Compute the layout.
G.layout(weight="membership")

# Let's view this graph.
G.visualize(
    "predictedsubjects.png",
    weight="membership",
    edge_width_multiplier=1
    )
```

![predictedsubs](/src/assets/tutorials/predictedsubjects.png)

There you go! Obviously, the layout is different than the one presented in
Gagnon A. _et al._ (2025) since we have must less subjects. You are now ready to
use those membership values in your statistical analysis!
