### Loading and Preparing Data

The `NeuroStatX` package provides modular data loading utilities for **tabular** and **network-based** data,
commonly encountered in neurocognitive and connectomic research.
This tutorial introduces the two main loader classes:

- `DatasetLoader` for structured behavioral, cognitive, or demographic data
- `GraphLoader` for network data (e.g., constructing a graph from fuzzy membership values)

---

### **`DatasetLoader`**

The `DatasetLoader` class is designed to be able to contain tabular-like data 
and access various basic information automatically. You can also interact with
the data, apply functions, and save it in multiple formats.

Here is a brief list of the underlying functions:
- Load data from any formats.
- Import data from existing objects.
- Access metadata.
- Join dataset together.
- Save in any formats.
- Apply custom functions.

#### **Basic Usage**

To cover the basic usage of the `DatasetLoader` class, let's use the `data/example.csv`
spreadsheet. It contains 50 dummy subjects, with their sex, age, cognitive, and
behavioral scores.

```python
from neurostatx.io.loader import DatasetLoader

# Initialize the loader
df = DatasetLoader()

# Load the dataframe
df.load_data("data/example.csv")
```

**Accessing basic metadata**

Our example dataset is currently loaded, we can access some basic information,
such as the number of subjects or the number of variables it contains. 

```python
print(df.get_metadata())
```
Running this will return:
```
{'nb_subjects': 50, 'nb_variables': 9}
```
**Filtering methods**

Once loaded, one might be interested in dropping some columns, or extracting only
the descriptive columns from the dataset. The `DatasetLoader` already have built-in
functions to do this. Let's start by viewing the top 5 rows of the data.

```python
df.get_data().head(5)
```
```csv
      ids     Sex   Age       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM
0  PC2VLN  Female  10.9  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885
1  XL1LON    Male  11.6  0.712829  0.893640  0.629955  0.446043  0.422631  0.336953
2  F6OQK5    Male  10.7 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549
3  TJWBKZ    Male  10.3 -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835
4  KWQW9D    Male  10.8 -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617
```

We can see two descriptive columns, `Age` and `Sex`. Now, let's try extracting them.

```python
df.get_descriptive_columns([1,2]).head(5) # Since they are at position 1 and 2 in the columns
```
```csv
      Sex   Age
0  Female  10.9
1    Male  11.6
2    Male  10.7
3    Male  10.3
4    Male  10.8
```

However, they were not removed from the actual dataset, simply _**extracted**_.
Let's truly remove them from the dataset now using the `drop_columns()` function.

```python
df.drop_columns([1,2])
df.get_data().head(5)
```
```csv
      ids       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM
0  PC2VLN  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885
1  XL1LON  0.712829  0.893640  0.629955  0.446043  0.422631  0.336953
2  F6OQK5 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549
3  TJWBKZ -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835
4  KWQW9D -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617
```

As you can see, they were successfully removed from the dataset! Now you get the basics
for loading and manipulating datasets. In the following tutorials, you will also learn
to apply functions, and use this class to process and organize your data!
Let's move to the `GraphLoader` class now.

---

### **`GraphLoader`**

The `GraphLoader` class is a versatile class to load, build, save, and visualize
graph network object. Similarly to the `DatasetLoader` class, any functions can
be applied to this class, assuming it it suppose to run a graph network object.
Here is a brief list of possible functions:
- Load a graph network from a file in any format.
- Build a graph from an edge list.
- Compute the layout of the graph.
- Add/fetch attributes to nodes or edges.
- Visualize the graph network.
- Save the graph network in any format.

#### **Basic Usage**

Since we do not have a graph network, let's create a small dataframe to build a
graph from using the `GraphLoader` class.

```python
import pandas as pd
from neurostatx.io.loader import GraphLoader

data = pd.DataFrame({'source': ['c1', 'c2', 'c3'],
                     'target': ['c2', 'c3', 'c1'],
                     'weight': [0.2, 0.5, 0.7]})

# Build our graph.
G = GraphLoader().build_graph(data, edge_attr="weight")
```

We now have a built graph network to play around with! As you can see in the code
snippet above, it contains 3 nodes (a, b, c), with three weighted edges (a -> b, b -> c, and
c -> a). Now let's try visualizing it. First, we need to compute a layout, meaning we
need to determine where our nodes will be in our network space. For weighted graph,
this allows the relative position of each node to be determined using the edge's weight.
Higher weight will mean closer positions between nodes, and vice-versa.

:::note
There is some randomness in the layout function, so recomputing the layout of any
graph network will results in some changes between iterations.
:::

```python
G.layout(weight="weight")
G.visualize("test.png", weight="weight")
```

If you open `test.png`, you will see your graph network with weight as the
edge color and size!

If you want, you can play around with the `visualize()` function to get the look
you desire. Here a modified version of the previous graph. Of course, the node positions
will stay the same, since we do not recompute the layout.

```python
G.visualize("test.png",
            weight="weight",
            centroid_node_shape=1000,
            centroid_node_color="lightgray",
            colormap="viridis",
            title="Beautiful Graph Network",
            legend_title="Weight")
```

**Adding node and edge attributes**

An interesting aspect of graph network is that you can append data to both nodes
and edges. For example, if nodes are subjects, we could potentially add demographic
data such as age. First, let's look at which data is currently associated with each
node.

```python
G.get_graph().nodes(data=True)
```
```python
NodeDataView({'c1': {'pos': [0.9999999999999999, -0.13638075527832896]}, 'c2': {'pos': [-0.9483498360161102, -0.5075132847536213]}, 'c3': {'pos': [-0.05165016398389009, 0.6438940400319502]}})
```

Let's now add age to each node and see what happen.

```python
# Create a dictionary of age for each node.
age = {
    "c1": {"age": 20},
    "c2": {"age": 26},
    "c3": {"age": 32}
}

# Add it to the graph object.
G.add_node_attribute(age)
G.get_graph().nodes(data=True)
```
```python
NodeDataView({'c1': {'pos': [0.9999999999999999, -0.13638075527832896], 'age': 20}, 'c2': {'pos': [-0.9483498360161102, -0.5075132847536213], 'age': 26}, 'c3': {'pos': [-0.05165016398389009, 0.6438940400319502], 'age': 32}})
```

You can now see that each node has its associated age. To add edge attributes,
you can repeat the previous process but use the `add_edge_attributes()` function.
Here is a small example.

```python
# Create a dictionary of pair of nodes and the edge attribute.
length = {
    ("c1", "c2"): {"length": 100},
    ("c2", "c3"): {"length": 200},
    ("c3", "c1"): {"length": 150}
}

# Add it to the graph.
G.add_edge_attribute(length)
G.get_graph().edges(data=True)
```

```python
EdgeDataView([('c1', 'c2', {'weight': 0.2, 'length': 100}), ('c1', 'c3', {'weight': 0.7, 'length': 150}), ('c2', 'c3', {'weight': 0.5, 'length': 200})])
```

You can even see the previous `weight` data that we initially set! Now, we could recompute
a graph layout using the length rather than weight, and visualize the results.

```python
# Layout computation.
G.layout(weight="length")
G.visualize("test_length.png", weight="length")
```

![GraphNetworkLength](/src/assets/tutorials/graphnetworklength.png)

There it is! You recomputed and visualize the graph network using the length
data rather than the weight. Now, you can save your graph network using `save_graph()`,
and then load it back using `load_graph()` !
