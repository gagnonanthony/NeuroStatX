### Loading and Preparing Data

The `NeuroStatX` package provides modular data loading utilities for **tabular** and **network-based** data
commonly encountered in neurocognitive and connectomic research.
This tutorial introduces the two main loader classes:

- `DatasetLoader` for structured behavioral, cognitive, or demographic data
- `GraphLoader` for network data (e.g., constructing a graph from fuzzy membership values)

:::note
If you haven't installed `neurostatx` yet, you can do it via `pip`! Or head over to the [installation section](/NeuroStatX/getting-started/installation).
```bash
pip install neurostatx
```

### **`DatasetLoader`**

The `DatasetLoader` class is designed to be able to contain **tabular-like data**
and access various kind of basic information automatically. You can also interact with
the data, apply functions, and save it in multiple formats.

Here is a brief list of the underlying functions:
- Load data from **any formats**.
- Import data from **existing objects**.
- Access metadata.
- **Join** dataset together.
- Save in any formats.
- Apply **custom functions**.

#### **Basic Usage**

To cover the basic usage of the `DatasetLoader` class, let's use the `data/example.csv`
spreadsheet. You can find this dataset on the `data/` folder on the 
[`NeuroStatX GitHub`](https://github.com/gagnonanthony/NeuroStatX).
It contains 50 dummy subjects, with their sex, age, cognitive, and
behavioral scores.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
from neurostatx.io.loader import DatasetLoader

# Initialize the loader
df = DatasetLoader()

# Load the dataframe
df.load_data("data/example.csv")
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

**Accessing basic metadata**

Our example dataset is currently loaded, we can access some basic information,
such as the number of subjects or the number of variables it contains. 

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
print(df.get_metadata())
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```
{'nb_subjects': 50, 'nb_variables': 9}
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

**Filtering methods**

Once loaded, one might be interested in dropping some columns, or extracting only
the descriptive columns from the dataset. The `DatasetLoader` already have built-in
functions to do this. Let's start by viewing the top 5 rows of the data.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
df.get_data().head(5)
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
      ids     Sex   Age       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM
0  PC2VLN  Female  10.9  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885
1  XL1LON    Male  11.6  0.712829  0.893640  0.629955  0.446043  0.422631  0.336953
2  F6OQK5    Male  10.7 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549
3  TJWBKZ    Male  10.3 -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835
4  KWQW9D    Male  10.8 -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

We can see two descriptive columns, `Age` and `Sex`. Now, let's try extracting them.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
df.get_descriptive_columns([1,2]).head(5) # Since they are at position 1 and 2 in the columns
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
      Sex   Age
0  Female  10.9
1    Male  11.6
2    Male  10.7
3    Male  10.3
4    Male  10.8
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

However, they were not removed from the actual dataset, simply _**extracted**_.
Let's truly remove them from the dataset now using the `drop_columns()` function.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
df.drop_columns([1,2])
df.get_data().head(5)
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
      ids       Int       Ext    Stress        VA      EFPS       MEM
0  PC2VLN  0.853711 -0.155164  0.356608 -0.009190 -0.312745  0.046885
1  XL1LON  0.712829  0.893640  0.629955  0.446043  0.422631  0.336953
2  F6OQK5 -0.055407  1.236605  0.501959 -0.657493 -0.451615 -0.343549
3  TJWBKZ -0.172911 -1.340310 -0.582634  0.238857 -0.144028 -0.178835
4  KWQW9D -0.258481 -0.895303 -0.610380 -0.297869 -0.111272  0.016617
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

As you can see, they were successfully removed from the dataset! Now you get the basics
for loading and manipulating datasets. In the following tutorials, you will also learn
to apply functions, and use this class to process and organize your data!
Let's move to the `GraphLoader` class now.

---

### **`GraphLoader`**

The `GraphLoader` class is a versatile class to load, build, save, and visualize
graph network object. Similarly to the `DatasetLoader` class, any functions can
be applied to this class, assuming it is designed to run on a graph network object.
Here is a brief list of currently implemented functions:
- Load a graph network from a file in any format.
- Build a graph from an edge list.
- Compute the layout of the graph.
- Add/fetch attributes to nodes or edges.
- Visualize the graph network.
- Save the graph network in any format.

#### **Basic Usage**

Since we do not have currently a graph network, let's build one from scratch, starting
by creating a small dataframe then feeding it to the `GraphLoader` class.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
import pandas as pd
from neurostatx.io.loader import GraphLoader

# Dummy dataframe containing 3 columns and 3 rows.
data = pd.DataFrame({
      'source': ['c1', 'c2', 'c3'],
      'target': ['c2', 'c3', 'c1'],
      'weight': [0.2, 0.5, 0.7]
})

# Build our graph.
G = GraphLoader().build_graph(data, edge_attr="weight")
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

We now have a built graph network to play around with! As you can see in the code
snippet above, it contains 3 nodes (a, b, c), with three weighted edges (a -> b, b -> c, and
c -> a). Now let's try visualizing it. First, we need to compute a layout, meaning we
need to determine where our nodes will be in our network space. There is multiple
options to do this, but let's stick to the default for now (e.g., spring layout).
For weighted graph, this allows the relative position of each node to be
determined using the edge's weight.

:::note
There is some randomness in the layout function, so recomputing the layout of any
graph network will results in some changes between iterations.
:::

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
G.layout(weight="weight")
G.visualize("test.png", weight="weight")
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

If you open `test.png`, you will see your graph network with weight as the
edge color and size!

If you want, you can play around with the `visualize()` function to get the look
you desire. Here a modified version of the previous graph. Of course, the node positions
will stay the same, since we did not recompute the layout.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
G.visualize("test.png",
            weight="weight",
            centroid_node_shape=1000,
            centroid_node_color="lightgray",
            colormap="viridis",
            title="Beautiful Graph Network",
            legend_title="Weight")
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

**Adding node and edge attributes**

An interesting aspect of graph network is that you can append data to both nodes
and edges. For example, if nodes are subjects, we could potentially add demographic
data such as age to each node. First, let's look at which data is currently contained within
each node.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
G.get_graph().nodes(data=True)
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
NodeDataView({'c1': {'pos': [0.9999999999999999, -0.13638075527832896]}, 'c2': {'pos': [-0.9483498360161102, -0.5075132847536213]}, 'c3': {'pos': [-0.05165016398389009, 0.6438940400319502]}})
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

We see that only the node positions is accessible for now. Those came from our
previous computation of the graph layout. Let's now add age to each node and
see what happen.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
# Create a dictionary of age for each node.
age = {
    "c1": {"age": 20},
    "c2": {"age": 26},
    "c3": {"age": 32}
}

# Add it to the graph object.
G.add_node_attribute(age)
G.get_graph().nodes(data=True)
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
NodeDataView({'c1': {'pos': [0.9999999999999999, -0.13638075527832896], 'age': 20}, 'c2': {'pos': [-0.9483498360161102, -0.5075132847536213], 'age': 26}, 'c3': {'pos': [-0.05165016398389009, 0.6438940400319502], 'age': 32}})
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

You can see that each node has now its associated age. To add edge attributes,
you can repeat the previous process but use the `add_edge_attributes()` function.
Here is a small example.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
# Create a dictionary of pair of nodes and the edge attribute.
length = {
    ("c1", "c2"): {"length": 100},
    ("c2", "c3"): {"length": 200},
    ("c3", "c1"): {"length": 150}
}

# Add it to the graph.
G.add_edge_attribute(length)
G.get_graph().edges(data=True)
```
</span>
<span slot="output">
```python
EdgeDataView([('c1', 'c2', {'weight': 0.2, 'length': 100}), ('c1', 'c3', {'weight': 0.7, 'length': 150}), ('c2', 'c3', {'weight': 0.5, 'length': 200})])
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

You can even see the previous `weight` data that we initially set! Now, we could recompute
a graph layout using the length rather than weight, and visualize the results.

<CommandOutputs>
<span slot="command">
```python
# Layout computation.
G.layout(weight="length")
G.visualize("test_length.png", weight="length")
```
</span>
</CommandOutputs>

![GraphNetworkLength](../../../assets/tutorials/graphnetworklength.png)

There it is! You recomputed and visualized the graph network using the length
data rather than the weight. Now, you can save your graph network using `save_graph()`,
and then load it back using `load_graph()` similarly to the `DatasetLoader`.
